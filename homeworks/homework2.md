1. Report the names of all authors and the title_name of the books (if any) they have authored.
2. Find the name of the publishers who have not published any book. (use outer join)
3. For each book title, list the tite_name, the publisher's name and the author's name
4. Find the name of publisher that published the book with the greatest royalty rate
5. Find the title name of the most expensive computer book, the name of its author and the publisher's name.
1. List the books published in the last 16 years. Note that your query should remain correct in the future, which means the number 2000 AND 2016 should not appear anywhere in the query.
2. List the author names in the form `{first initial}{period}{space}{last name}`, e.g. K. Hull. Order the results first by last name, then by first name. Only list those authors who have both a first name and a last name in the database.  
3. List the following information of all authors: the first name, the position of the first occurrence of 'e' within the first name, the last name, the position of the first occurrence of 'ma' within the last name. Use proper column names.
4. List the name(s) of the publisher(s) that published the book with the shortest title name.
